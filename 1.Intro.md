# Intro
Interpreters are programs take other programs as their input and
produce something.\
They take source code and evaluate it without producing some visible,
intermediate result that can
later be executed. In contrast to compilers, which take source code
and produce output
in another language that the underlying system can understand.\
Some interpreters do not parse and instead interpret right away,
others compiler to bytecode which they then evaluate. JIT ones,
compile input just-in-time to native machine code that gets executed.

Between the two extremes; there are interpreters that parse the source code,
build an abstract syntax tree (AST) out of it and then evaluate this
tree: Tree wlking interpreter.\
That is what we'll build.

### cali
Each interpreter is built to interpret a particular lang; that's how u
implement a lang.\
The lang we build, cali(named after Jua cali) will be;\
- C-like syntax,
- variable bindings
- integers and booleans
- built-in functions
- closures
- string, array & hash data structures
- etc
```bash
let age = 1;
let name = "hello";
let result = 10 * (20 / 2);

let myArray = [1, 2, 5];
let myHash = {"name": "Thorsten", "age": 28};
let add = fn(a, b) { return a + b; };

// higher order funcs; funcs taking other funcs as args
let twice = fn(f, x) {
return f(f(x));
};
let addTwo = fn(x) {
return x + 2;
};
twice(addTwo, 2); // => 6
```

The interpreter will have these parts:
- lexer
- parser
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- internal object system
- evaluator
