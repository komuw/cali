# Parsing

### 1. Parser
They take input(tokens, strings etc) and produce AST.  
  
  
```javascript
> var input = '{"name": "Thorsten", "age": 28}';
> var output = JSON.parse(input);
> output
{ name: 'Thorsten', age: 28 }
```
The above is a JS json parser taking string as input and producing a datastructure representing the input.  
The `abstract` in AST is based on the fact that certain details visible in the source code are omitted in the AST eg semicolons, newlines, whitespace etc  

Parsers take source code as input (either as text or tokens) and produce a data structure which represents this source code.  
While creating that data structure, they also analyse the input, checking that it conforms to the expected structure.   
Thus the process of parsing is also called `syntactic analysis`. That is where you get the famous; `parseError`  

We'll create a parser for khaled, it's input will be the tokens produced by the [lexer](2.Lexing.md)  
We'll also define our own AST, suited to khaled.
