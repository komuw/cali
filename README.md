## khaled          


khaled is an interpreted programming language.           
It's name is derived from hip hop artiste; DJ Khaled.                      

Implemented as I was reading;  [Writing An Interpreter In Go - by Thorsten Ball.](https://interpreterbook.com/)   
That book is worth every penny.             

khaled ships with an inbuilt REPL, which you can start by typing;             

`> khaled`
```bash
Bless up komuw!
